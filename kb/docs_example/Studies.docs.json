Previously, we reported preliminary results concerning the regulation of small RNA secretion in colorectal cancer cells using cell culture models. These RNA profiles were performed using exosomes and cells from three isogenic colon cancer lines: parental DLD-1 with both wild type and mutant KRAS alleles; DKS-8 (a single wild-type KRAS allele); and DKO-1 (a single mutant KRAS allele). We show that our exosomal preparations purified by traditional ultracentrifugation techniques contain lipoprotein complexes, as well as secreted vesicles consistent with exosomes. Part of our strategy going forward is to distinguish which RNAs are associated with vesicles or lipoproteins to understand how extracellular secretion is differentially regulated and whether it might be co-regulated by mutant KRAS. In addition to secreted RNAs that appear to be regulated by KRAS status and that are enriched in exosomes, we have analyzed unique features present in the short secreted RNAs. We have also performed long-RNAseq analysis on these same samples and will provide a preliminary analysis of longer RNA transcripts present in the media.

To test whether exosomal RNAs also contribute to changes in gene expression in recipient cells, and whether mutant KRAS might regulate the composition of secreted microRNAs (miRNAs), we compared small RNAs of cells and matched exosomes from isogenic CRC cell lines differing only in KRAS status. We show that exosomal profiles are distinct from cellular profiles, and mutant exosomes cluster separately from wild-type KRAS exosomes. miR-10b was selectively increased in wild-type exosomes, while miR-100 was increased in mutant exosomes. Neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition caused accumulation of miR-100 only in mutant cells, suggesting KRAS-dependent miRNA export. In Transwell co-culture experiments, mutant donor cells conferred miR-100-mediated target repression in wild-type-recipient cells.

RNAs originating from hard to access tissues, such as neurons within the brain and spinal cord, have the potential to get to the periphery where they can be detected non-invasively. The formation and extracellular release of microvesicles and RNA binding proteins have been found to carry RNA from cells of the central nervous system to the periphery and protect the RNA from degradation. Extracellular miRNAs detectable in peripheral circulation can provide information about cellular changes associated with human health and disease. In order to associate miRNA signals present in cell-free peripheral biofluids with neurodegenerative disease status of patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, we assessed the miRNA content in cerebrospinal fluid and serum from postmortem subjects with full neuropathology evaluations. We profiled the miRNA content from 69 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 67 with Parkinson's disease and 78 neurologically normal controls using next generation small RNA sequencing (NGS). We report the average abundance of each detected miRNA in cerebrospinal fluid and in serum and describe 13 novel miRNAs that were identified. We correlated changes in miRNA expression with aspects of disease severity such as Braak stage, dementia status, plaque and tangle densities, and the presence and severity of Lewy body pathology. Many of the differentially expressed miRNAs detected in peripheral cell-free cerebrospinal fluid and serum were previously reported in the literature to be deregulated in brain tissue from patients with neurodegenerative disease. These data indicate that extracellular miRNAs detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum are reflective of cell-based changes in pathology and can be used to assess disease progression and therapeutic efficacy."},"DOI":{"value":"10.1371/journal.pone.0094839"}}}}]},"Related Submissions":{"value":1,"items":[{"Related Submission":{"value":"EXR-KJENS1ADPD0000-SU","properties":{"DocURL":{"value":"coll/Submissions/doc/EXR-KJENS1ADPD0000-SU"}}}}]},"Aliases":{"value":1,"items":[{"Accession":{"value":"phs000727.v1.p1","properties":{"dbName":{"value":"dbGaP"},"URL":{"value":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000727.v1.p1"}}}}]}}}},
