Cells are washed three times with PBS and cultured for an additional 48 hrs in serum-free medium. The serum-free conditioned medium is collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 x g to remove cellular debris, and the resulting supernatant is filtered through a 0.22-?m polyether-sulfone filter (Nalgene, Rochester, NY) to reduce microparticle contamination. The filtrate is concentrated approximately 300-fold with a 100,000 molecular-weight cutoff centrifugal concentrator (Millipore). The concentrate is centrifuged at 165,000 x g for 2.5 hrs. The exosome-enriched pellet is resuspended by successive syringing thru 22-, 27-, and 30-gauge syringes seven times each in PBS containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.35) and washed by centrifuging again at 165,000 x g for 2.5 hrs. The wash steps are repeated until no trace of phenol-red is detected. The resulting pellet is resuspended in PBS containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.35) and the protein concentrations of the exosome preparations determined with a MicroBCA kit (Pierce). Then total RNA from exosomes and cells was isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies/Thermo). In the case of exosomal RNA isolation TRIzol was incubated with 100 ul or less of concentrated exosomes for an extended 15 min incubation prior to chloroform extraction. RNA pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of RNase-free water and were then re-purified using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA).
